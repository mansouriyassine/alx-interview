0. Change comes from within

Given a pile of coins of different values, determine the fewest number
of coins needed to meet a given amount total.

Prototype:
    def makeChange(coins, total)

Returns:
    The fewest number of coins needed to meet the total.
    - If total is 0 or less, return 0.
    - If total cannot be met by any number of coins you have, return -1.

Args:
    coins (list): A list of the values of the coins in your possession.
    total (int): The total amount to be achieved using the fewest number
                 of coins.

Assumptions:
    - The value of a coin will always be an integer greater than 0.
    - You can assume you have an infinite number of each denomination of
      coin in the list.

Your solutionâ€™s runtime will be evaluated in this task.
